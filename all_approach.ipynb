       "      <td>The late effects of various immunosuppressive insults on cell-mediated immunity in mice were studied in an attempt to assess the role of immune surveillance in the aging process. Results were obtained using susceptibility to allogeneic tumor cell challenge, graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR), blastogenic response to PHA, a thymus derived T cell-specific plant mitogen, and cytolytic activity against allogeneic tumor cells as measures of immunologic activity. In vivo studies late in life show that resistance to allogeneic tumor cells is significantly decreased in thymectomized mice, whereas those treated with cortisone, cyclophosphamide and sublethal X-ray remain unchanged. Spleen cells from only the thymectomized and the sublethally irradiated mice show reduced activity in the GVHR. No difference is seen in the activity of bone marrow cells. Results consistent with these findings were obtained in in vitro studies. Thus spleen cells from thymectomized or sublethally irradiated mice show decreased activity is response to PHA, whereas no change is seen in spleen cells from other treated groups. Hence, surgical and physical insults are more likely to induce long-lasting immunosuppression in those immunocompetent tissues whose activity normally diminishes with advancing age. Furthermore, the degree of immunosuppression seen in this study is not of the order of magnitude that one could reasonably predict a significant decrease in mean life-span.\\n</td>\n",

Analysis of a widely scattered literature indicates that hormones and neural factors regulate a great number of cellular aging phenomena of mammals. It is proposed that age-related changes after maturation result from an extension of the neural and endocrine mechanisms that control earlier development and that produce a regulatory cascade of changing neural, endocrine, and target-tissue interactions.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Hand Test was administered to 27 older adults of both sexes (Mage = 66.56) to investigate possible changes in personality concomitant with normal aging. To control partially for such factors as cultural influences and intelligence differences a matched-pair design was used in which the test protocols of the older adults were matched with those of their children of the same sex (Mage = 36.44). Though the Hand Test has not been independently validated on older adults, results were consistent with past findings using projective techniques inasmuch as depletion and constriction of personality were noted. Criticisms of research on the clinical assessment of the elderly were discussed.\\n</td>\n",

Cell counts in the substantia nigra where this dopaminergic tract originates suggest that the decrease in enzyme activity is partly due to cell loss, but must largely reflect decreased activity of residual cells. It is possible that this loss may account for some of the difficulties in movement seen in aged individuals and that it might be less if pigment formation in these cells could be inhibited.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>In previous studies, using transcriptomic analysis, we observed higher levels of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) gene expression in the peripheral blood cells of centenarians compared to octogenarians. This suggests the potential significance of this receptor in maintaining physiological balance and promoting healthy aging, possibly linked to its critical role in detoxifying xenobiotics. In our current study, we confirmed that AHR expression is indeed higher in centenarians. We employed C. elegans as a model known for its suitability in longevity studies to explore whether the AHR pathway has a significant impact on lifespan and healthspan. Our survival assays revealed that two different mutants of AHR-1 exhibited lower longevity. Additionally, we used a mouse model to examine whether supplementation with pomegranate extract modulates the expression of AHR pathway genes in the liver. Furthermore, we studied a nutritional strategy based on pomegranate extract administration to investigate its potential modulation of life- and healthspan in worms.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Women typically outlive men, yet they often experience greater frailty and a higher incidence of chronic diseases as they age. By exploring the biological foundations of aging, with a particular focus on telomere dynamics, this manuscript aims to describe how dietary and lifestyle choices can significantly influence the aging process. The review comprehensively examines current research, underscoring the power of nutrition to counteract age-related changes, support healthy aging, and maintain vitality and beauty in women. The exploration of telomeres-the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes-reveals how they serve as markers of cellular aging and are potential targets for interventions aimed at enhancing women's longevity and quality of life. This study also emphasizes the importance of sex-specific approaches and precision medicine in understanding the unique health challenges women face as they age. By proposing targeted strategies, the review seeks to address these challenges, offering insights into preventive measures that can foster resilience, promote well-being, and extend healthy life expectancy in women. Ultimately, this work provides a sophisticated understanding of the aging process in women, highlighting the pivotal role of tailored interventions in preserving both health and beauty.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation create a perpetual cycle in the elderly, where impaired immune function amplifies susceptibility to oxidative damage, and oxidative stress further weakens the immune response. This cycle is particularly detrimental to the respiratory system of the elderly, which is an easy target for constant exogenous harmful attacks during cold/flu season or under heavy air pollution. Herbal medicines that protect respiratory function are seen as safer alternatives to conventional therapies; however, there is limited availability of scientifically validated, safe, and effective natural supplements for these conditions. In this study, we evaluated a standardized bioflavonoid composition, UP446, that contains bioactives from the roots of Scutellaria baicalensis and the heartwoods of Acacia catechu as a natural and nutritional supplement for its antioxidative and immunoregulatory effects in oxidative stress-accelerated aging and chemically induced immune suppression mouse models. Immunosenescence was induced through the repeated subcutaneous inoculation of D-galactose (D-Gal) at a dose of 500 mg/kg/day in CD-1 mice. UP446 was administered orally at doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg starting in the fifth week of immunosenescence induction. This study lasted a total of ten weeks. All mice received a quadrivalent influenza vaccine 2 weeks before termination. Whole blood, serum, spleen homogenate, and thymus tissues were processed for analysis. Cyclophosphamide (Cy)-induced immunosuppression was triggered by three consecutive injections of cyclophosphamide at 80 mg/kg/day, followed by the oral administration of UP446 for 18 days at doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg. Blood was collected from each animal at necropsy, and serum was isolated for IgA and IgG ELISA analysis. UP446 was found to improve immune response, as evidenced by the stimulation of innate (NK cells) and adaptive immune responses (T cells and cytotoxic T cells), an increase in antioxidant capacity (glutathione peroxidase), the preservation of vital immune organs (the thymus), and a reduction in NFÎºB. UP446 also increased serum levels of IgA and IgG. The findings presented in this report demonstrate the antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and immune-regulatory activities of UP446, suggesting its potential use in respiratory conditions involving immune stress due to aging, oxidative stress, and/or pathogenic challenges.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>It has been demonstrated that filbertone, the principal flavor compound of hazelnuts, exhibits preventive effects against hypothalamic inflammation, obesity, neurodegenerative diseases, and muscle lipid accumulation. However, its influence on muscle aging has yet to be elucidated. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of filbertone on muscle aging in C2C12 myotubes subjected to senescence induction by either doxorubicin or hydrogen peroxide. To ascertain the mechanisms by which filbertone exerts its effects, we conducted a series of experiments, including Western blot analysis, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase (SA-Î²-gal) staining. Filbertone was markedly observed to decrease not only the protein levels of p53 (p &lt; 0.01) in senescence-induced skeletal muscle cells, but also the gene expression levels of p21 (p &lt; 0.05), a direct target of p53. The expression of muscle-related genes, including myogenin and muscle RING-finger protein-1 (MuRF1), was found to be significantly enhanced in senescent muscle cells following treatment with filbertone (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, the number of senescent skeletal muscle cells exhibiting Î²-galactosidase activity was found to be markedly reduced in the presence of filbertone (p &lt; 0.01). Collectively, these findings suggest that filbertone plays a pivotal role in the regulation of muscle aging.\\n</td>\n",

Results were obtained using susceptibility to allogeneic tumor cell challenge, graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR), blastogenic response to PHA, a thymus derived T cell-specific plant mitogen, and cytolytic activity against allogeneic tumor cells as measures of immunologic activity. In vivo studies late in life show that resistance to allogeneic tumor cells is significantly decreased in thymectomized mice, whereas those treated with cortisone, cyclophosphamide and sublethal X-ray remain unchanged. Spleen cells from only the thymectomized and the sublethally irradiated mice show reduced activity in the GVHR. No difference is seen in the activity of bone marrow cells. Results consistent with these findings were obtained in in vitro studies. Thus spleen cells from thymectomized or sublethally irradiated mice show decreased activity is response to PHA, whereas no change is seen in spleen cells from other treated groups. Hence, surgical and physical insults are more likely to induce long-lasting immunosuppression in those immunocompetent tissues whose activity normally diminishes with advancing age. Furthermore, the degree of immunosuppression seen in this study is not of the order of magnitude that one could reasonably predict a significant decrease in mean life-span.\\n   \n",

Analysis of a widely scattered literature indicates that hormones and neural factors regulate a great number of cellular aging phenomena of mammals. It is proposed that age-related changes after maturation result from an extension of the neural and endocrine mechanisms that control earlier development and that produce a regulatory cascade of changing neural, endocrine, and target-tissue interactions.\\n   \n",

To control partially for such factors as cultural influences and intelligence differences a matched-pair design was used in which the test protocols of the older adults were matched with those of their children of the same sex (Mage = 36.44). Though the Hand Test has not been independently validated on older adults, results were consistent with past findings using projective techniques inasmuch as depletion and constriction of personality were noted. Criticisms of research on the clinical assessment of the elderly were discussed.\\n   \n",

They establish that immunization improves the activity of RES of the experimentally aged rats; still, its phagocytic and digestive functions remain by far feebler than those of the rats unsubjected to experimental ageing. By the aged animals the RES insufficiency is more pronounced towards the intracellular bacterium Brucella abortus 19, than towards the extracellular Diplococcus pneumoniae.\\n   \n",

The most severe loss found was that in striatal tyrosine hydroxylase activity, the rate-controlling enzyme in the synthesis of dopamine. Cell counts in the substantia nigra where this dopaminergic tract originates suggest that the decrease in enzyme activity is partly due to cell loss, but must largely reflect decreased activity of residual cells. It is possible that this loss may account for some of the difficulties in movement seen in aged individuals and that it might be less if pigment formation in these cells could be inhibited.\\n   \n",

This suggests the potential significance of this receptor in maintaining physiological balance and promoting healthy aging, possibly linked to its critical role in detoxifying xenobiotics. In our current study, we confirmed that AHR expression is indeed higher in centenarians. We employed C. elegans as a model known for its suitability in longevity studies to explore whether the AHR pathway has a significant impact on lifespan and healthspan. Our survival assays revealed that two different mutants of AHR-1 exhibited lower longevity. Additionally, we used a mouse model to examine whether supplementation with pomegranate extract modulates the expression of AHR pathway genes in the liver. Furthermore, we studied a nutritional strategy based on pomegranate extract administration to investigate its potential modulation of life- and healthspan in worms.\\n   \n",

By exploring the biological foundations of aging, with a particular focus on telomere dynamics, this manuscript aims to describe how dietary and lifestyle choices can significantly influence the aging process. The review comprehensively examines current research, underscoring the power of nutrition to counteract age-related changes, support healthy aging, and maintain vitality and beauty in women. The exploration of telomeres-the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes-reveals how they serve as markers of cellular aging and are potential targets for interventions aimed at enhancing women's longevity and quality of life. This study also emphasizes the importance of sex-specific approaches and precision medicine in understanding the unique health challenges women face as they age. By proposing targeted strategies, the review seeks to address these challenges, offering insights into preventive measures that can foster resilience, promote well-being, and extend healthy life expectancy in women. Ultimately, this work provides a sophisticated understanding of the aging process in women, highlighting the pivotal role of tailored interventions in preserving both health and beauty.\\n   \n",
       "4544253  Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation create a perpetual cycle in the elderly, where impaired immune function amplifies susceptibility to oxidative damage, and oxidative stress further weakens the immune response. This cycle is particularly detrimental to the respiratory system of the elderly, which is an easy target for constant exogenous harmful attacks during cold/flu season or under heavy air pollution. Herbal medicines that protect respiratory function are seen as safer alternatives to conventional therapies; however, there is limited availability of scientifically validated, safe, and effective natural supplements for these conditions. In this study, we evaluated a standardized bioflavonoid composition, UP446, that contains bioactives from the roots of Scutellaria baicalensis and the heartwoods of Acacia catechu as a natural and nutritional supplement for its antioxidative and immunoregulatory effects in oxidative stress-accelerated aging and chemically induced immune suppression mouse models. Immunosenescence was induced through the repeated subcutaneous inoculation of D-galactose (D-Gal) at a dose of 500 mg/kg/day in CD-1 mice. UP446 was administered orally at doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg starting in the fifth week of immunosenescence induction. This study lasted a total of ten weeks. All mice received a quadrivalent influenza vaccine 2 weeks before termination. Whole blood, serum, spleen homogenate, and thymus tissues were processed for analysis. Cyclophosphamide (Cy)-induced immunosuppression was triggered by three consecutive injections of cyclophosphamide at 80 mg/kg/day, followed by the oral administration of UP446 for 18 days at doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg. Blood was collected from each animal at necropsy, and serum was isolated for IgA and IgG ELISA analysis. UP446 was found to improve immune response, as evidenced by the stimulation of innate (NK cells) and adaptive immune responses (T cells and cytotoxic T cells), an increase in antioxidant capacity (glutathione peroxidase), the preservation of vital immune organs (the thymus), and a reduction in NFÎºB. UP446 also increased serum levels of IgA and IgG. The findings presented in this report demonstrate the antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and immune-regulatory activities of UP446, suggesting its potential use in respiratory conditions involving immune stress due to aging, oxidative stress, and/or pathogenic challenges.\\n   \n",

However, its influence on muscle aging has yet to be elucidated. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of filbertone on muscle aging in C2C12 myotubes subjected to senescence induction by either doxorubicin or hydrogen peroxide. To ascertain the mechanisms by which filbertone exerts its effects, we conducted a series of experiments, including Western blot analysis, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase (SA-Î²-gal) staining. Filbertone was markedly observed to decrease not only the protein levels of p53 (p < 0.01) in senescence-induced skeletal muscle cells, but also the gene expression levels of p21 (p < 0.05), a direct target of p53. The expression of muscle-related genes, including myogenin and muscle RING-finger protein-1 (MuRF1), was found to be significantly enhanced in senescent muscle cells following treatment with filbertone (p < 0.05). In addition, the number of senescent skeletal muscle cells exhibiting Î²-galactosidase activity was found to be markedly reduced in the presence of filbertone (p < 0.01). Collectively, these findings suggest that filbertone plays a pivotal role in the regulation of muscle aging.\\n   \n",

This cycle is particularly detrimental to the respiratory system of the elderly, which is an easy target for constant exogenous harmful attacks during cold/flu season or under heavy air pollution. Herbal medicines that protect respiratory function are seen as safer alternatives to conventional therapies; however, there is limited availability of scientifically validated, safe, and effective natural supplements for these conditions. In this study, we evaluated a standardized bioflavonoid composition, UP446, that contains bioactives from the roots of Scutellaria baicalensis and the heartwoods of Acacia catechu as a natural and nutritional supplement for its antioxidative and immunoregulatory effects in oxidative stress-accelerated aging and chemically induced immune suppression mouse models. Immunosenescence was induced through the repeated subcutaneous inoculation of D-galactose (D-Gal) at a dose of 500 mg/kg/day in CD-1 mice. UP446 was administered orally at doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg starting in the fifth week of immunosenescence induction. This study lasted a total of ten weeks. All mice received a quadrivalent influenza vaccine 2 weeks before termination. Whole blood, serum, spleen homogenate, and thymus tissues were processed for analysis. Cyclophosphamide (Cy)-induced immunosuppression was triggered by three consecutive injections of cyclophosphamide at 80 mg/kg/day, followed by the oral administration of UP446 for 18 days at doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg. Blood was collected from each animal at necropsy, and serum was isolated for IgA and IgG ELISA analysis. UP446 was found to improve immune response, as evidenced by the stimulation of innate (NK cells) and adaptive immune responses (T cells and cytotoxic T cells), an increase in antioxidant capacity (glutathione peroxidase), the preservation of vital immune organs (the thymus), and a reduction in NFÎºB. UP446 also increased serum levels of IgA and IgG. The findings presented in this report demonstrate the antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and immune-regulatory activities of UP446, suggesting its potential use in respiratory conditions involving immune stress due to aging, oxidative stress, and/or pathogenic challenges.\\n</td>\n",

Immunosenescence was induced through the repeated subcutaneous inoculation of D-galactose (D-Gal) at a dose of 500 mg/kg/day in CD-1 mice. UP446 was administered orally at doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg starting in the fifth week of immunosenescence induction. This study lasted a total of ten weeks. All mice received a quadrivalent influenza vaccine 2 weeks before termination. Whole blood, serum, spleen homogenate, and thymus tissues were processed for analysis. Cyclophosphamide (Cy)-induced immunosuppression was triggered by three consecutive injections of cyclophosphamide at 80 mg/kg/day, followed by the oral administration of UP446 for 18 days at doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg. Blood was collected from each animal at necropsy, and serum was isolated for IgA and IgG ELISA analysis. UP446 was found to improve immune response, as evidenced by the stimulation of innate (NK cells) and adaptive immune responses (T cells and cytotoxic T cells), an increase in antioxidant capacity (glutathione peroxidase), the preservation of vital immune organs (the thymus), and a reduction in NFÎºB. UP446 also increased serum levels of IgA and IgG. The findings presented in this report demonstrate the antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and immune-regulatory activities of UP446, suggesting its potential use in respiratory conditions involving immune stress due to aging, oxidative stress, and/or pathogenic challenges.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>It has been demonstrated that filbertone, the principal flavor compound of hazelnuts, exhibits preventive effects against hypothalamic inflammation, obesity, neurodegenerative diseases, and muscle lipid accumulation. However, its influence on muscle aging has yet to be elucidated. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of filbertone on muscle aging in C2C12 myotubes subjected to senescence induction by either doxorubicin or hydrogen peroxide. To ascertain the mechanisms by which filbertone exerts its effects, we conducted a series of experiments, including Western blot analysis, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase (SA-Î²-gal) staining. Filbertone was markedly observed to decrease not only the protein levels of p53 (p &lt; 0.01) in senescence-induced skeletal muscle cells, but also the gene expression levels of p21 (p &lt; 0.05), a direct target of p53. The expression of muscle-related genes, including myogenin and muscle RING-finger protein-1 (MuRF1), was found to be significantly enhanced in senescent muscle cells following treatment with filbertone (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, the number of senescent skeletal muscle cells exhibiting Î²-galactosidase activity was found to be markedly reduced in the presence of filbertone (p &lt; 0.01). Collectively, these findings suggest that filbertone plays a pivotal role in the regulation of muscle aging.\\n</td>\n",

Results were obtained using susceptibility to allogeneic tumor cell challenge, graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR), blastogenic response to PHA, a thymus derived T cell-specific plant mitogen, and cytolytic activity against allogeneic tumor cells as measures of immunologic activity. In vivo studies late in life show that resistance to allogeneic tumor cells is significantly decreased in thymectomized mice, whereas those treated with cortisone, cyclophosphamide and sublethal X-ray remain unchanged. Spleen cells from only the thymectomized and the sublethally irradiated mice show reduced activity in the GVHR. No difference is seen in the activity of bone marrow cells. Results consistent with these findings were obtained in in vitro studies. Thus spleen cells from thymectomized or sublethally irradiated mice show decreased activity is response to PHA, whereas no change is seen in spleen cells from other treated groups. Hence, surgical and physical insults are more likely to induce long-lasting immunosuppression in those immunocompetent tissues whose activity normally diminishes with advancing age. Furthermore, the degree of immunosuppression seen in this study is not of the order of magnitude that one could reasonably predict a significant decrease in mean life-span.\\n   \n",

Analysis of a widely scattered literature indicates that hormones and neural factors regulate a great number of cellular aging phenomena of mammals. It is proposed that age-related changes after maturation result from an extension of the neural and endocrine mechanisms that control earlier development and that produce a regulatory cascade of changing neural, endocrine, and target-tissue interactions.\\n   \n",

To control partially for such factors as cultural influences and intelligence differences a matched-pair design was used in which the test protocols of the older adults were matched with those of their children of the same sex (Mage = 36.44). Though the Hand Test has not been independently validated on older adults, results were consistent with past findings using projective techniques inasmuch as depletion and constriction of personality were noted. Criticisms of research on the clinical assessment of the elderly were discussed.\\n   \n",

The most severe loss found was that in striatal tyrosine hydroxylase activity, the rate-controlling enzyme in the synthesis of dopamine. Cell counts in the substantia nigra where this dopaminergic tract originates suggest that the decrease in enzyme activity is partly due to cell loss, but must largely reflect decreased activity of residual cells. It is possible that this loss may account for some of the difficulties in movement seen in aged individuals and that it might be less if pigment formation in these cells could be inhibited.\\n   \n",

This suggests the potential significance of this receptor in maintaining physiological balance and promoting healthy aging, possibly linked to its critical role in detoxifying xenobiotics. In our current study, we confirmed that AHR expression is indeed higher in centenarians. We employed C. elegans as a model known for its suitability in longevity studies to explore whether the AHR pathway has a significant impact on lifespan and healthspan. Our survival assays revealed that two different mutants of AHR-1 exhibited lower longevity. Additionally, we used a mouse model to examine whether supplementation with pomegranate extract modulates the expression of AHR pathway genes in the liver. Furthermore, we studied a nutritional strategy based on pomegranate extract administration to investigate its potential modulation of life- and healthspan in worms.\\n   \n",

By exploring the biological foundations of aging, with a particular focus on telomere dynamics, this manuscript aims to describe how dietary and lifestyle choices can significantly influence the aging process. The review comprehensively examines current research, underscoring the power of nutrition to counteract age-related changes, support healthy aging, and maintain vitality and beauty in women. The exploration of telomeres-the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes-reveals how they serve as markers of cellular aging and are potential targets for interventions aimed at enhancing women's longevity and quality of life. This study also emphasizes the importance of sex-specific approaches and precision medicine in understanding the unique health challenges women face as they age. By proposing targeted strategies, the review seeks to address these challenges, offering insights into preventive measures that can foster resilience, promote well-being, and extend healthy life expectancy in women. Ultimately, this work provides a sophisticated understanding of the aging process in women, highlighting the pivotal role of tailored interventions in preserving both health and beauty.\\n   \n",
       "4544253  Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation create a perpetual cycle in the elderly, where impaired immune function amplifies susceptibility to oxidative damage, and oxidative stress further weakens the immune response. This cycle is particularly detrimental to the respiratory system of the elderly, which is an easy target for constant exogenous harmful attacks during cold/flu season or under heavy air pollution. Herbal medicines that protect respiratory function are seen as safer alternatives to conventional therapies; however, there is limited availability of scientifically validated, safe, and effective natural supplements for these conditions. In this study, we evaluated a standardized bioflavonoid composition, UP446, that contains bioactives from the roots of Scutellaria baicalensis and the heartwoods of Acacia catechu as a natural and nutritional supplement for its antioxidative and immunoregulatory effects in oxidative stress-accelerated aging and chemically induced immune suppression mouse models. Immunosenescence was induced through the repeated subcutaneous inoculation of D-galactose (D-Gal) at a dose of 500 mg/kg/day in CD-1 mice. UP446 was administered orally at doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg starting in the fifth week of immunosenescence induction. This study lasted a total of ten weeks. All mice received a quadrivalent influenza vaccine 2 weeks before termination. Whole blood, serum, spleen homogenate, and thymus tissues were processed for analysis. Cyclophosphamide (Cy)-induced immunosuppression was triggered by three consecutive injections of cyclophosphamide at 80 mg/kg/day, followed by the oral administration of UP446 for 18 days at doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg. Blood was collected from each animal at necropsy, and serum was isolated for IgA and IgG ELISA analysis. UP446 was found to improve immune response, as evidenced by the stimulation of innate (NK cells) and adaptive immune responses (T cells and cytotoxic T cells), an increase in antioxidant capacity (glutathione peroxidase), the preservation of vital immune organs (the thymus), and a reduction in NFÎºB. UP446 also increased serum levels of IgA and IgG. The findings presented in this report demonstrate the antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and immune-regulatory activities of UP446, suggesting its potential use in respiratory conditions involving immune stress due to aging, oxidative stress, and/or pathogenic challenges.\\n   \n",

However, its influence on muscle aging has yet to be elucidated. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of filbertone on muscle aging in C2C12 myotubes subjected to senescence induction by either doxorubicin or hydrogen peroxide. To ascertain the mechanisms by which filbertone exerts its effects, we conducted a series of experiments, including Western blot analysis, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase (SA-Î²-gal) staining. Filbertone was markedly observed to decrease not only the protein levels of p53 (p < 0.01) in senescence-induced skeletal muscle cells, but also the gene expression levels of p21 (p < 0.05), a direct target of p53. The expression of muscle-related genes, including myogenin and muscle RING-finger protein-1 (MuRF1), was found to be significantly enhanced in senescent muscle cells following treatment with filbertone (p < 0.05). In addition, the number of senescent skeletal muscle cells exhibiting Î²-galactosidase activity was found to be markedly reduced in the presence of filbertone (p < 0.01). Collectively, these findings suggest that filbertone plays a pivotal role in the regulation of muscle aging.\\n   \n",

II. Cell-mediated immune activity. The late effects of various immunosuppressive insults on cell-mediated immunity in mice were studied in an attempt to assess the role of immune surveillance in the aging process. Results were obtained using susceptibility to allogeneic tumor cell challenge, graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR), blastogenic response to PHA, a thymus derived T cell-specific plant mitogen, and cytolytic activity against allogeneic tumor cells as measures of immunologic activity. In vivo studies late in life show that resistance to allogeneic tumor cells is significantly decreased in thymectomized mice, whereas those treated with cortisone, cyclophosphamide and sublethal X-ray remain unchanged. Spleen cells from only the thymectomized and the sublethally irradiated mice show reduced activity in the GVHR. No difference is seen in the activity of bone marrow cells. Results consistent with these findings were obtained in in vitro studies. Thus spleen cells from thymectomized or sublethally irradiated mice show decreased activity is response to PHA, whereas no change is seen in spleen cells from other treated groups. Hence, surgical and physical insults are more likely to induce long-lasting immunosuppression in those immunocompetent tissues whose activity normally diminishes with advancing age. Furthermore, the degree of immunosuppression seen in this study is not of the order of magnitude that one could reasonably predict a significant decrease in mean life-span.\\n   \n",

Much evidence suggests that intrinsic molecular or cellular aging mechanisms need not be invoked to explain most age-related cellular changes and pathologcical conditions. Analysis of a widely scattered literature indicates that hormones and neural factors regulate a great number of cellular aging phenomena of mammals. It is proposed that age-related changes after maturation result from an extension of the neural and endocrine mechanisms that control earlier development and that produce a regulatory cascade of changing neural, endocrine, and target-tissue interactions.\\n   \n",

The Hand Test was administered to 27 older adults of both sexes (Mage = 66.56) to investigate possible changes in personality concomitant with normal aging. To control partially for such factors as cultural influences and intelligence differences a matched-pair design was used in which the test protocols of the older adults were matched with those of their children of the same sex (Mage = 36.44). Though the Hand Test has not been independently validated on older adults, results were consistent with past findings using projective techniques inasmuch as depletion and constriction of personality were noted. Criticisms of research on the clinical assessment of the elderly were discussed.\\n   \n",

The authors study the activity of RES in rats with Progeria-like syndrome of Selye, at the occasion of a repeated infection with bacteria--intracellular parasites (Brucella abortus 19) and bacteria--extracellular parasites (Diplococcus pneumoniae). They establish that immunization improves the activity of RES of the experimentally aged rats; still, its phagocytic and digestive functions remain by far feebler than those of the rats unsubjected to experimental ageing. By the aged animals the RES insufficiency is more pronounced towards the intracellular bacterium Brucella abortus 19, than towards the extracellular Diplococcus pneumoniae.\\n   \n",

Measurements on human brain samples of some enzymes concerned with neurotransmitter synthesis suggest serious losses with age. The most severe loss found was that in striatal tyrosine hydroxylase activity, the rate-controlling enzyme in the synthesis of dopamine. Cell counts in the substantia nigra where this dopaminergic tract originates suggest that the decrease in enzyme activity is partly due to cell loss, but must largely reflect decreased activity of residual cells. It is possible that this loss may account for some of the difficulties in movement seen in aged individuals and that it might be less if pigment formation in these cells could be inhibited.\\n   \n",

In previous studies, using transcriptomic analysis, we observed higher levels of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) gene expression in the peripheral blood cells of centenarians compared to octogenarians. This suggests the potential significance of this receptor in maintaining physiological balance and promoting healthy aging, possibly linked to its critical role in detoxifying xenobiotics. In our current study, we confirmed that AHR expression is indeed higher in centenarians. We employed C. elegans as a model known for its suitability in longevity studies to explore whether the AHR pathway has a significant impact on lifespan and healthspan. Our survival assays revealed that two different mutants of AHR-1 exhibited lower longevity. Additionally, we used a mouse model to examine whether supplementation with pomegranate extract modulates the expression of AHR pathway genes in the liver. Furthermore, we studied a nutritional strategy based on pomegranate extract administration to investigate its potential modulation of life- and healthspan in worms.\\n   \n",

By exploring the biological foundations of aging, with a particular focus on telomere dynamics, this manuscript aims to describe how dietary and lifestyle choices can significantly influence the aging process. The review comprehensively examines current research, underscoring the power of nutrition to counteract age-related changes, support healthy aging, and maintain vitality and beauty in women. The exploration of telomeres-the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes-reveals how they serve as markers of cellular aging and are potential targets for interventions aimed at enhancing women's longevity and quality of life. This study also emphasizes the importance of sex-specific approaches and precision medicine in understanding the unique health challenges women face as they age. By proposing targeted strategies, the review seeks to address these challenges, offering insights into preventive measures that can foster resilience, promote well-being, and extend healthy life expectancy in women. Ultimately, this work provides a sophisticated understanding of the aging process in women, highlighting the pivotal role of tailored interventions in preserving both health and beauty.\\n   \n",
       "4544253  Botanical Bioflavonoid Composition from Scutellaria baicalensis- and Acacia catechu-Protected Mice against D-Galactose-Induced Immunosenescence, and Cyclophosphamide Induced Immune Suppression. Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation create a perpetual cycle in the elderly, where impaired immune function amplifies susceptibility to oxidative damage, and oxidative stress further weakens the immune response. This cycle is particularly detrimental to the respiratory system of the elderly, which is an easy target for constant exogenous harmful attacks during cold/flu season or under heavy air pollution. Herbal medicines that protect respiratory function are seen as safer alternatives to conventional therapies; however, there is limited availability of scientifically validated, safe, and effective natural supplements for these conditions. In this study, we evaluated a standardized bioflavonoid composition, UP446, that contains bioactives from the roots of Scutellaria baicalensis and the heartwoods of Acacia catechu as a natural and nutritional supplement for its antioxidative and immunoregulatory effects in oxidative stress-accelerated aging and chemically induced immune suppression mouse models. Immunosenescence was induced through the repeated subcutaneous inoculation of D-galactose (D-Gal) at a dose of 500 mg/kg/day in CD-1 mice. UP446 was administered orally at doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg starting in the fifth week of immunosenescence induction. This study lasted a total of ten weeks. All mice received a quadrivalent influenza vaccine 2 weeks before termination. Whole blood, serum, spleen homogenate, and thymus tissues were processed for analysis. Cyclophosphamide (Cy)-induced immunosuppression was triggered by three consecutive injections of cyclophosphamide at 80 mg/kg/day, followed by the oral administration of UP446 for 18 days at doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg. Blood was collected from each animal at necropsy, and serum was isolated for IgA and IgG ELISA analysis. UP446 was found to improve immune response, as evidenced by the stimulation of innate (NK cells) and adaptive immune responses (T cells and cytotoxic T cells), an increase in antioxidant capacity (glutathione peroxidase), the preservation of vital immune organs (the thymus), and a reduction in NFÎºB. UP446 also increased serum levels of IgA and IgG. The findings presented in this report demonstrate the antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and immune-regulatory activities of UP446, suggesting its potential use in respiratory conditions involving immune stress due to aging, oxidative stress, and/or pathogenic challenges.\\n   \n",

It has been demonstrated that filbertone, the principal flavor compound of hazelnuts, exhibits preventive effects against hypothalamic inflammation, obesity, neurodegenerative diseases, and muscle lipid accumulation. However, its influence on muscle aging has yet to be elucidated. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of filbertone on muscle aging in C2C12 myotubes subjected to senescence induction by either doxorubicin or hydrogen peroxide. To ascertain the mechanisms by which filbertone exerts its effects, we conducted a series of experiments, including Western blot analysis, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase (SA-Î²-gal) staining. Filbertone was markedly observed to decrease not only the protein levels of p53 (p < 0.01) in senescence-induced skeletal muscle cells, but also the gene expression levels of p21 (p < 0.05), a direct target of p53. The expression of muscle-related genes, including myogenin and muscle RING-finger protein-1 (MuRF1), was found to be significantly enhanced in senescent muscle cells following treatment with filbertone (p < 0.05). In addition, the number of senescent skeletal muscle cells exhibiting Î²-galactosidase activity was found to be markedly reduced in the presence of filbertone (p < 0.01). Collectively, these findings suggest that filbertone plays a pivotal role in the regulation of muscle aging.\\n   \n",

It is proposed that age-related changes after maturation result from an extension of the neural and endocrine mechanisms that control earlier development and that produce a regulatory cascade of changing neural, endocrine, and target-tissue interactions.\\n</td>\n",

Our findings reveal that curcumin significantly prolongs the PoMiCL of wildtype yeast cells, with the most pronounced effects observed at lower concentrations, indicating a hormetic response. Importantly, curcumin also extends the lifespan of postmitotic cells with mitochondrial deficiencies, although the hormetic effect is absent in these defective cells.

Analysis of a widely scattered literature indicates that hormones and neural factors regulate a great number of cellular aging phenomena of mammals. It is proposed that age-related changes after maturation result from an extension of the neural and endocrine mechanisms that control earlier development and that produce a regulatory cascade of changing neural, endocrine, and target-tissue interactions.\\n   \n",

In this paper, the rat liver is presented as a promising model for studying cellular phenomena underlying organ ageing. The recent development of methods for isolation and purification of parenchymal, Kupffer and endothelial cells from the rat liver makes possible the comparison of functional and metabolic changes in the intact liver with changes in distinct liver cell classes isolated from rats of various age groups. An attempt has been made to correlate age changes in some important liver-specific functions, such as bromsulophthalein uptake and albumin synthesis, at the organ and at the cellular level. To compare cellular ageing phenomena in long-lived cells (parenchymal cells) and short lived cells (Kupffer and endothelial cells) from the same organ, the role of lysosomes in cellular ageing processes was investigated, with secial reference to the functioning of the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D. The specific cathepsin D activity in Kupffer cells was abour 3 times higher than in endothelial cells and about 20 times higher than in parenchymal cells. The enzyme activity in the latter cell type showed a significant increase with age.\\n   \n",

In the model of vitality the error rate mu corresponds to the ageing-factor. The ageing-factors of several physical functions can be determined from the ascent of decrease of these functions. The standardized ageing-factors of the considered physiological functions range from 0.001 to 0.017 year--1 and are smaller than the ageing-factor of the whole organism. The date of the occurrence of pathological manifestations as a result of ageing-conditioned decrease of functions can be estimated by means of the ageing-factors.\\n   \n",

In this paper age-dependent changes of the adaptation of a number of enzymes are described. Experiments from our laboratory indicate that pyruvate kinase is more responsive to starvation and refeeding in young animals. The diminished response of pyruvate kinase in old age is caused by a decreased adaptability of the regulatory isoenzyme PK-L.\\n   \n",

Our goal was to determine whether Fisetin can reduce human biological aging, as verified by the TruAge test. This would be the first study in healthy human adults over the age of 50 years old to determine if Fisetin can reduce their biological age. Fisetin 500 mg daily was administered for one week per month for six months. The results showed that four out of ten healthy adults experienced a reduction in biological aging, five out of ten saw an increase, and one out of ten had no change. No adverse effects were noted among the ten subjects. Telomere lengths did not statistically change with the use of Fisetin. Because five of ten had an increase in biological age, taking Fisetin as an anti- aging agent is not recommended until more extensive studies are done.\\n   \n",

Understanding the mechanisms behind aging is crucial for developing therapeutic interventions. This study investigates the effects of curcumin on postmitotic cellular lifespan (PoMiCL) during chronological aging in yeast, a widely used model for human postmitotic cellular aging. Our findings reveal that curcumin significantly prolongs the PoMiCL of wildtype yeast cells, with the most pronounced effects observed at lower concentrations, indicating a hormetic response. Importantly, curcumin also extends the lifespan of postmitotic cells with mitochondrial deficiencies, although the hormetic effect is absent in these defective cells. Mechanistically, curcumin inhibits TORC1 activity, enhances ATP levels, and induces oxidative stress. These results suggest that curcumin has the potential to modulate aging and offer therapeutic insights into age-related diseases, highlighting the importance of context in its effects.\\n   \n",
       "4544218  Pomegranate is a notable source of nutrients, containing a considerable proportion of organic acids, polysaccharides, vitamins, fatty acids, and polyphenols such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, and tannins. It is also rich in nutritionally important minerals and chemical elements such as K, P, Na, Ca, Mg, and N. The presence of several bioactive compounds and metabolites in pomegranate has led to its incorporation into the functional food category, where it is used for its numerous therapeutic properties. Pomegranate's bioactive compounds have shown antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. Aging is a process characterized by the chronic accumulation of damages, progressively compromising cells, tissues, and organs over time. Inflammaging is a chronic, subclinical, low-grade inflammation that occurs during the aging process and is linked to many age-related diseases. This review aims to summarize and discuss the evidence of the benefits of pomegranate extract and its compounds to slow the aging processes by intervening in the mechanisms underlying inflammaging. These studies mainly concern neurodegenerative and skin diseases, while studies in other fields of application need to be more practical. Furthermore, no human studies have demonstrated the anti-inflammaging effects of pomegranate. In the future, supplementation with pomegranate extracts, polyphenols, or urolithins could represent a valuable low-risk complementary therapy for patients with difficult-to-manage diseases, as well as a valid therapeutic alternative for the topical or systemic treatment of skin pathologies.\\n   \n",

Therefore, to reduce the incidence of such diseases and improve human health, it becomes important to find ways to combat such damage. In this sense, geroprotectors have been suggested as molecules that could slow down or prevent age-related diseases. On the other hand, nutraceuticals are another set of compounds that align with the need to prevent diseases and promote health since they are biologically active molecules (occurring naturally in food) that, apart from having a nutritional role, have preventive properties, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antitumoral, just to mention a few. Therefore, in the present review using the specialized databases Scopus and PubMed we collected information from articles published from 2010 to 2023 in order to describe the role of nutraceuticals during the aging process and, given their role in targeting the hallmarks of aging, we suggest that they are potential geroprotectors that could be consumed as part of our regular diet or administered additionally as nutritional supplements.\\n   \n",

Knowledge regarding the causes of these changes and identification of new key anatomic structures have helped elucidate one of the most complex areas of the human body. This has resulted in the introduction of pharmacologic agents to help stop, mitigate, or counteract signs of aging and restore the youthful appearance of the face. The authors performed a systematic search of the literature to review the current highest-level evidence of facial antiaging pharmacologic agents. Pharmacologic and minimally invasive antiaging treatments can target different components of facial aging and continue to evolve. With continuous research efforts, traditional treatments, such as botulinum toxin type A, injectable fillers, and chemical peels, are emerging in newer, more effective formulations, with longer lasting clinical results. However, for soft-tissue descent and facial volume loss, surgery remains the standard treatment. An adequate understanding of the three-dimensional process of facial aging over time (the fourth dimension), facial anatomy, and the pharmacologic properties of antiaging/rejuvenation agents are the sine qua non of facial antiaging treatment. The specific modality should be tailored to patient characteristics, preferences, and goals.\\n   \n",

Much evidence suggests that intrinsic molecular or cellular aging mechanisms need not be invoked to explain most age-related cellular changes and pathologcical conditions. Analysis of a widely scattered literature indicates that hormones and neural factors regulate a great number of cellular aging phenomena of mammals. It is proposed that age-related changes after maturation result from an extension of the neural and endocrine mechanisms that control earlier development and that produce a regulatory cascade of changing neural, endocrine, and target-tissue interactions.\\n   \n",

The experimental results indicating a primary genetic cause of aging and some diseases of the old age (cancer, arteriosclerosis, immune deficiency, autoimmune diseases) are summarized under two aspects: 1) The genetic influence is determined during the differentiation and development phase of the organism, whereby the direct or indirect (pleiotropic effect) selection of genes of aging, or the missing selection of genes which are acting against aging come into consideration. 2) The dicisive gene alterations take place by spontaneous and/or induced somatic mutations.\\n   \n",

The cellular basis of the age-related decline in the functional capacity of many mammalian organs is still poorly understood. In this paper, the rat liver is presented as a promising model for studying cellular phenomena underlying organ ageing. The recent development of methods for isolation and purification of parenchymal, Kupffer and endothelial cells from the rat liver makes possible the comparison of functional and metabolic changes in the intact liver with changes in distinct liver cell classes isolated from rats of various age groups. An attempt has been made to correlate age changes in some important liver-specific functions, such as bromsulophthalein uptake and albumin synthesis, at the organ and at the cellular level. To compare cellular ageing phenomena in long-lived cells (parenchymal cells) and short lived cells (Kupffer and endothelial cells) from the same organ, the role of lysosomes in cellular ageing processes was investigated, with secial reference to the functioning of the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D. The specific cathepsin D activity in Kupffer cells was abour 3 times higher than in endothelial cells and about 20 times higher than in parenchymal cells. The enzyme activity in the latter cell type showed a significant increase with age.\\n   \n",

The ageing-factors of several physical functions can be determined from the ascent of decrease of these functions. The standardized ageing-factors of the considered physiological functions range from 0.001 to 0.017 year--1 and are smaller than the ageing-factor of the whole organism. The date of the occurrence of pathological manifestations as a result of ageing-conditioned decrease of functions can be estimated by means of the ageing-factors.\\n   \n",

Enzyme adaptation, age (author's transl). Age-dependent modifications of enzyme adaptations in response to a variety of environmental alterations are a biochemical expression of biological ageing. In this paper age-dependent changes of the adaptation of a number of enzymes are described. Experiments from our laboratory indicate that pyruvate kinase is more responsive to starvation and refeeding in young animals. The diminished response of pyruvate kinase in old age is caused by a decreased adaptability of the regulatory isoenzyme PK-L.\\n   \n",

Fisetin, a natural flavonoid compound, is a senolytic agent that has shown promise in extending the lifespan of aging mice. Our goal was to determine whether Fisetin can reduce human biological aging, as verified by the TruAge test. This would be the first study in healthy human adults over the age of 50 years old to determine if Fisetin can reduce their biological age. Fisetin 500 mg daily was administered for one week per month for six months. The results showed that four out of ten healthy adults experienced a reduction in biological aging, five out of ten saw an increase, and one out of ten had no change. No adverse effects were noted among the ten subjects. Telomere lengths did not statistically change with the use of Fisetin. Because five of ten had an increase in biological age, taking Fisetin as an anti- aging agent is not recommended until more extensive studies are done.\\n   \n",

Aging is an inevitable biological process that contributes to the onset of age-related diseases, often as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction. Understanding the mechanisms behind aging is crucial for developing therapeutic interventions. This study investigates the effects of curcumin on postmitotic cellular lifespan (PoMiCL) during chronological aging in yeast, a widely used model for human postmitotic cellular aging. Our findings reveal that curcumin significantly prolongs the PoMiCL of wildtype yeast cells, with the most pronounced effects observed at lower concentrations, indicating a hormetic response. Importantly, curcumin also extends the lifespan of postmitotic cells with mitochondrial deficiencies, although the hormetic effect is absent in these defective cells. Mechanistically, curcumin inhibits TORC1 activity, enhances ATP levels, and induces oxidative stress. These results suggest that curcumin has the potential to modulate aging and offer therapeutic insights into age-related diseases, highlighting the importance of context in its effects.\\n   \n",
       "4544218  Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) Extract Effects on Inflammaging. Pomegranate is a notable source of nutrients, containing a considerable proportion of organic acids, polysaccharides, vitamins, fatty acids, and polyphenols such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, and tannins. It is also rich in nutritionally important minerals and chemical elements such as K, P, Na, Ca, Mg, and N. The presence of several bioactive compounds and metabolites in pomegranate has led to its incorporation into the functional food category, where it is used for its numerous therapeutic properties. Pomegranate's bioactive compounds have shown antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. Aging is a process characterized by the chronic accumulation of damages, progressively compromising cells, tissues, and organs over time. Inflammaging is a chronic, subclinical, low-grade inflammation that occurs during the aging process and is linked to many age-related diseases. This review aims to summarize and discuss the evidence of the benefits of pomegranate extract and its compounds to slow the aging processes by intervening in the mechanisms underlying inflammaging. These studies mainly concern neurodegenerative and skin diseases, while studies in other fields of application need to be more practical. Furthermore, no human studies have demonstrated the anti-inflammaging effects of pomegranate. In the future, supplementation with pomegranate extracts, polyphenols, or urolithins could represent a valuable low-risk complementary therapy for patients with difficult-to-manage diseases, as well as a valid therapeutic alternative for the topical or systemic treatment of skin pathologies.\\n   \n",

Aging is the result of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damages over time, meaning that \"the more damage we accumulate, the higher the possibility to develop age-related diseases\". Therefore, to reduce the incidence of such diseases and improve human health, it becomes important to find ways to combat such damage. In this sense, geroprotectors have been suggested as molecules that could slow down or prevent age-related diseases. On the other hand, nutraceuticals are another set of compounds that align with the need to prevent diseases and promote health since they are biologically active molecules (occurring naturally in food) that, apart from having a nutritional role, have preventive properties, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antitumoral, just to mention a few. Therefore, in the present review using the specialized databases Scopus and PubMed we collected information from articles published from 2010 to 2023 in order to describe the role of nutraceuticals during the aging process and, given their role in targeting the hallmarks of aging, we suggest that they are potential geroprotectors that could be consumed as part of our regular diet or administered additionally as nutritional supplements.\\n   \n",

Aging of the face is the result of the interrelation of three-dimensional changes occurring over time among the 5 different layers of the face and its associated structures. Knowledge regarding the causes of these changes and identification of new key anatomic structures have helped elucidate one of the most complex areas of the human body. This has resulted in the introduction of pharmacologic agents to help stop, mitigate, or counteract signs of aging and restore the youthful appearance of the face. The authors performed a systematic search of the literature to review the current highest-level evidence of facial antiaging pharmacologic agents. Pharmacologic and minimally invasive antiaging treatments can target different components of facial aging and continue to evolve. With continuous research efforts, traditional treatments, such as botulinum toxin type A, injectable fillers, and chemical peels, are emerging in newer, more effective formulations, with longer lasting clinical results. However, for soft-tissue descent and facial volume loss, surgery remains the standard treatment. An adequate understanding of the three-dimensional process of facial aging over time (the fourth dimension), facial anatomy, and the pharmacologic properties of antiaging/rejuvenation agents are the sine qua non of facial antiaging treatment. The specific modality should be tailored to patient characteristics, preferences, and goals.\\n   \n",

       "      <td>Targeting multiple hallmarks of mammalian aging with combinations of interventions. Aging is currently viewed as a result of multiple biological processes that manifest themselves independently, reinforce each other and in their totality lead to the aged phenotype. Genetic and pharmaceutical approaches targeting specific underlying causes of aging have been used to extend the lifespan and healthspan of model organisms ranging from yeast to mammals. However, most interventions display only a modest benefit. This outcome is to be expected if we consider that even if one aging process is successfully treated, other aging pathways may remain intact. Hence solving the problem of aging may require targeting not one but many of its underlying causes at once. Here we review the challenges and successes of combination therapies aimed at increasing the lifespan of mammals and propose novel directions for their development. We conclude that both additive and synergistic effects on mammalian lifespan can be achieved by combining interventions that target the same or different hallmarks of aging. However, the number of studies in which multiple hallmarks were targeted simultaneously is surprisingly limited. We argue that this approach is as promising as it is understudied.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>The influential responsibility of sirtuins in senescence and associated diseases: A review. Aging is a process of time-associated depletion in the physiological functions, essential for the survival and reproducibility of living beings. Some age-related disorders can be successfully controlled with some biomedical techniques or pharmaceutical approaches. There are some precise remedies that demonstrate conspicuous promise in the preclinical and clinical setup of extending lifespan or enhancing health by altering natural senescence. The sirtuin family of proteins is one of the most favorable targets for antiaging strategies. Sirtuins were initially identified as transcription repressors in yeast, but today they are known to exist in bacteria and eukaryotes, as well as humans. The SIRT (1-7) family of proteins in humans is made up of seven members, each of which has either mono-ADP ribosyl transferase or deacetylase activity. Researchers suggest that sirtuins are essential for cell metabolism and play a major role in how cells react to various stimuli, such as oxidative or genotoxic stress. A healthy lifestyle, which includes exercise and a balanced diet, has been demonstrated to impact health span by adjusting the levels of sirtuins, suggesting the involvement of sirtuins in extending human longevity. The hunt for sirtuin activators is among the most extensive and comprehensive research subjects in the present scenario. Some optimism has been generated to investigate antiaging therapies by natural compounds, such as curcumin and others. This review article highlights the role of sirtuins in native senescence and their primordial roles in the progression of several life-threatening diseases. Further, it also provides recent information on the sirtuin activators and inhibitors and their therapeutic benefits.\\n</td>\n",

The advanced age population may be susceptible to an increased risk of adverse effects due to increased drug exposure after oral dosing. Factors such as high-interindividual variability and lack of data has led to poor characterization of absorption's role in pharmacokinetic changes in this population. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models are increasingly being used during the drug development process, as their unique qualities are advantageous in atypical scenarios such as drug-drug interactions or special populations such as older people. Along with relying on various sources of data, auxiliary tools including parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis techniques are employed to support model development and other applications. However, sensitivity analyses have mostly been limited to localized techniques in the majority of reported PBPK models using them. This is disadvantageous, since local sensitivity analyses are unsuitable for risk analysis, which require assessment of parametric interactions and proper coverage of the input space to better estimate and subsequently mitigate the effects of the phenomenon of interest. For this reason, this study seeks to integrate a global sensitivity analysis screening method with PBPK models based in PK-SimÂ® to characterize the consequences of potential changes in absorption that are often associated with advanced age. The Elementary Effects (Morris) method and visualization of the results are implemented in R and three model drugs representing Biopharmaceutical Classification System classes I-III that are expected to exhibit some sensitivity to three age-associated hypotheses were successfully tested.\\n</td>\n",

Since then, its use in diabetics has grown constantly, with over 150 million users today. The therapeutic profile also expanded, with improved understanding of novel mechanisms. Metformin has a major activity on insulin resistance, by acting on the insulin receptors and mitochondria, most likely by activation of the adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase. These and associated mechanisms lead to significant lipid lowering and body weight loss. An anti-cancer action has come up in recent years, with mechanisms partly dependent on the mitochondrial activity and also on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase resistance occurring in some malignant tumors. The potential of metformin to raise life-length is the object of large ongoing studies and of several basic and clinical investigations. The present review article will attempt to investigate the basic mechanisms behind these diverse activities and the potential clinical benefits. Metformin may act on transcriptional activity by histone modification, DNA methylation and miRNAs. An activity on age-associated inflammation (inflammaging) may occur via activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor and changes in gut microbiota. A senolytic activity, leading to reduction of cells with the senescent associated secretory phenotype, may be crucial in lifespan prolongation as well as in ancillary properties in age-associated diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. Telomere prolongation may be related to the activity on mitochondrial respiratory factor 1 and on peroxisome gamma proliferator coactivator 1-alpha. Very recent observations on the potential to act on the most severe neurological disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, have raised considerable hope.\\n</td>\n",

The highly polygenic nature of human longevity renders pleiotropy an indispensable feature of its genetic architecture. Leveraging the genetic correlation between aging-related traits (ARTs), we aimed to model the additive variance in lifespan as a function of the cumulative liability from pleiotropic segregating variants. We tracked allele frequency changes as a function of viability across different age bins and prioritized 34 variants with an immediate implication on lipid metabolism, body mass index (BMI), and cognitive performance, among other traits, revealed by PheWAS analysis in the UK Biobank. Given the highly complex and non-linear interactions between the genetic determinants of longevity, we reasoned that a composite polygenic score would approximate a substantial portion of the variance in lifespan and developed the integrated longevity genetic scores (iLGSs) for distinguishing exceptional survival. We showed that coefficients derived from our ensemble model could potentially reveal an interesting pattern of genomic pleiotropy specific to lifespan. We assessed the predictive performance of our model for distinguishing the enrichment of exceptional longevity among long-lived individuals in two replication cohorts (the Scripps Wellderly cohort and the Medical Genome Reference Bank (MRGB)) and showed that the median lifespan in the highest decile of our composite prognostic index is up to 4.8 years longer. Finally, using the proteomic correlates of iLGS, we identified protein markers associated with exceptional longevity irrespective of chronological age and prioritized drugs with repurposing potentials for gerotherapeutics. Together, our approach demonstrates a promising framework for polygenic modeling of additive liability conferred by ARTs in defining exceptional longevity and assisting the identification of individuals at a higher risk of mortality for targeted lifestyle modifications earlier in life. Furthermore, the proteomic signature associated with iLGS highlights the functional pathway upstream of the PI3K-Akt that can be effectively targeted to slow down aging and extend lifespan.\\n</td>\n",

Energy metabolism disorder, mainly exhibiting the inhibition of fatty acid degradation and lipid accumulation, is highly related with aging acceleration. However, the intervention measures are deficient. Here, we reported Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (Omega-3 PUFAs), especially EPA, exerted beneficial effects on maintaining energy metabolism and lipid homeostasis to slow organ aging. As the endogenous agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î± (PPARÎ±), Omega-3 PUFAs significantly boosted fatty acid Î²-oxidation and ATP production in multiple aged organs. Consequently, Omega-3 PUFAs effectively inhibited age-related pathological changes, preserved organ function, and retarded aging process. The beneficial effects of Omega-3 PUFAs were also testified in mfat-1 transgenic mice, which spontaneously generate abundant endogenous Omega-3 PUFAs.

Aging is an inevitable process in the human body, and cellular senescence refers to irreversible cell cycle arrest caused by external aging-promoting mechanisms. Moreover, as age increases, the accumulation of senescent cells limits both the health of the body and lifespan and even accelerates the occurrence and progression of age-related diseases. Therefore, it is crucial to delay the periodic irreversible arrest and continuous accumulation of senescent cells to address the issue of aging. The fundamental solution is targeted therapy focused on eliminating senescent cells or reducing the senescence-associated secretory phenotype.

Aging is currently viewed as a result of multiple biological processes that manifest themselves independently, reinforce each other and in their totality lead to the aged phenotype. Genetic and pharmaceutical approaches targeting specific underlying causes of aging have been used to extend the lifespan and healthspan of model organisms ranging from yeast to mammals. However, most interventions display only a modest benefit. This outcome is to be expected if we consider that even if one aging process is successfully treated, other aging pathways may remain intact. Hence solving the problem of aging may require targeting not one but many of its underlying causes at once. Here we review the challenges and successes of combination therapies aimed at increasing the lifespan of mammals and propose novel directions for their development. We conclude that both additive and synergistic effects on mammalian lifespan can be achieved by combining interventions that target the same or different hallmarks of aging. However, the number of studies in which multiple hallmarks were targeted simultaneously is surprisingly limited. We argue that this approach is as promising as it is understudied.\\n   \n",

Aging is a process of time-associated depletion in the physiological functions, essential for the survival and reproducibility of living beings. Some age-related disorders can be successfully controlled with some biomedical techniques or pharmaceutical approaches. There are some precise remedies that demonstrate conspicuous promise in the preclinical and clinical setup of extending lifespan or enhancing health by altering natural senescence. The sirtuin family of proteins is one of the most favorable targets for antiaging strategies. Sirtuins were initially identified as transcription repressors in yeast, but today they are known to exist in bacteria and eukaryotes, as well as humans. The SIRT (1-7) family of proteins in humans is made up of seven members, each of which has either mono-ADP ribosyl transferase or deacetylase activity. Researchers suggest that sirtuins are essential for cell metabolism and play a major role in how cells react to various stimuli, such as oxidative or genotoxic stress. A healthy lifestyle, which includes exercise and a balanced diet, has been demonstrated to impact health span by adjusting the levels of sirtuins, suggesting the involvement of sirtuins in extending human longevity. The hunt for sirtuin activators is among the most extensive and comprehensive research subjects in the present scenario. Some optimism has been generated to investigate antiaging therapies by natural compounds, such as curcumin and others. This review article highlights the role of sirtuins in native senescence and their primordial roles in the progression of several life-threatening diseases. Further, it also provides recent information on the sirtuin activators and inhibitors and their therapeutic benefits.\\n   \n",

The advanced age population may be susceptible to an increased risk of adverse effects due to increased drug exposure after oral dosing. Factors such as high-interindividual variability and lack of data has led to poor characterization of absorption's role in pharmacokinetic changes in this population. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models are increasingly being used during the drug development process, as their unique qualities are advantageous in atypical scenarios such as drug-drug interactions or special populations such as older people. Along with relying on various sources of data, auxiliary tools including parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis techniques are employed to support model development and other applications. However, sensitivity analyses have mostly been limited to localized techniques in the majority of reported PBPK models using them. This is disadvantageous, since local sensitivity analyses are unsuitable for risk analysis, which require assessment of parametric interactions and proper coverage of the input space to better estimate and subsequently mitigate the effects of the phenomenon of interest. For this reason, this study seeks to integrate a global sensitivity analysis screening method with PBPK models based in PK-SimÂ® to characterize the consequences of potential changes in absorption that are often associated with advanced age. The Elementary Effects (Morris) method and visualization of the results are implemented in R and three model drugs representing Biopharmaceutical Classification System classes I-III that are expected to exhibit some sensitivity to three age-associated hypotheses were successfully tested.\\n   \n",

The therapeutic profile also expanded, with improved understanding of novel mechanisms. Metformin has a major activity on insulin resistance, by acting on the insulin receptors and mitochondria, most likely by activation of the adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase. These and associated mechanisms lead to significant lipid lowering and body weight loss. An anti-cancer action has come up in recent years, with mechanisms partly dependent on the mitochondrial activity and also on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase resistance occurring in some malignant tumors. The potential of metformin to raise life-length is the object of large ongoing studies and of several basic and clinical investigations. The present review article will attempt to investigate the basic mechanisms behind these diverse activities and the potential clinical benefits. Metformin may act on transcriptional activity by histone modification, DNA methylation and miRNAs. An activity on age-associated inflammation (inflammaging) may occur via activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor and changes in gut microbiota. A senolytic activity, leading to reduction of cells with the senescent associated secretory phenotype, may be crucial in lifespan prolongation as well as in ancillary properties in age-associated diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. Telomere prolongation may be related to the activity on mitochondrial respiratory factor 1 and on peroxisome gamma proliferator coactivator 1-alpha. Very recent observations on the potential to act on the most severe neurological disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, have raised considerable hope.\\n   \n",

Advancements in understanding skin aging mechanisms, which encompass both external and internal aging processes, have spurred the development of innovative treatments primarily aimed at improving cosmetic appearance. These findings offer the potential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at achieving long-term, non-therapy-dependent clinical benefits, including the reversal of aging and the mitigation of associated health conditions. Realizing this goal requires further research to establish the safety and efficacy of targeting aging-related skin changes, such as pigmentation, wrinkling, and collagen loss. Systematic investigation is needed to identify the most effective interventions and determine optimal anti-aging treatment strategies. These reviews highlight the features and possible mechanisms of skin aging, as well as the latest progress and future direction of skin aging research, to provide a theoretical basis for new practical anti-skin aging strategies.\\n   \n",
       "4544165  Polygenic prediction of human longevity on the supposition of pervasive pleiotropy. The highly polygenic nature of human longevity renders pleiotropy an indispensable feature of its genetic architecture. Leveraging the genetic correlation between aging-related traits (ARTs), we aimed to model the additive variance in lifespan as a function of the cumulative liability from pleiotropic segregating variants. We tracked allele frequency changes as a function of viability across different age bins and prioritized 34 variants with an immediate implication on lipid metabolism, body mass index (BMI), and cognitive performance, among other traits, revealed by PheWAS analysis in the UK Biobank. Given the highly complex and non-linear interactions between the genetic determinants of longevity, we reasoned that a composite polygenic score would approximate a substantial portion of the variance in lifespan and developed the integrated longevity genetic scores (iLGSs) for distinguishing exceptional survival. We showed that coefficients derived from our ensemble model could potentially reveal an interesting pattern of genomic pleiotropy specific to lifespan. We assessed the predictive performance of our model for distinguishing the enrichment of exceptional longevity among long-lived individuals in two replication cohorts (the Scripps Wellderly cohort and the Medical Genome Reference Bank (MRGB)) and showed that the median lifespan in the highest decile of our composite prognostic index is up to 4.8 years longer. Finally, using the proteomic correlates of iLGS, we identified protein markers associated with exceptional longevity irrespective of chronological age and prioritized drugs with repurposing potentials for gerotherapeutics. Together, our approach demonstrates a promising framework for polygenic modeling of additive liability conferred by ARTs in defining exceptional longevity and assisting the identification of individuals at a higher risk of mortality for targeted lifestyle modifications earlier in life. Furthermore, the proteomic signature associated with iLGS highlights the functional pathway upstream of the PI3K-Akt that can be effectively targeted to slow down aging and extend lifespan.\\n   \n",

The aging process contributes significantly to the onset of chronic diseases, which are the primary causes of global mortality, morbidity, and healthcare costs. Numerous studies have shown that the removal of senescent cells from tissues extends lifespan and reduces the occurrence of age-related diseases. Consequently, there is growing momentum in the development of drugs targeting these cells. Among them, mTOR and SGLT-2 inhibitors have garnered attention due to their diverse effects: mTOR inhibitors regulate cellular growth, metabolism, and immune responses, while SGLT-2 inhibitors regulate glucose reabsorption in the kidneys, resulting in various beneficial metabolic effects. Importantly, these drugs may act synergistically by influencing senescence processes and pathways. Although direct studies on the combined effects of mTOR inhibition and SGLT-2 inhibition on age-related processes are limited, this review aims to highlight the potential synergistic benefits of these drugs in targeting senescence.\\n   \n",

However, gaps in understanding the precise mechanisms of curcumin's effects and the optimal dosages for different conditions necessitate further investigation. This systematic review synthesizes current evidence on curcumin's potential in addressing age-related disorders, emphasizing its impact on cognitive function, neurodegeneration, and muscle health in older adults. By evaluating the safety, efficacy, and mechanisms of action of curcumin supplementation, this review aims to provide insights into its therapeutic potential for promoting healthy aging.

Energy metabolism disorder, mainly exhibiting the inhibition of fatty acid degradation and lipid accumulation, is highly related with aging acceleration. However, the intervention measures are deficient. Here, we reported Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (Omega-3 PUFAs), especially EPA, exerted beneficial effects on maintaining energy metabolism and lipid homeostasis to slow organ aging. As the endogenous agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î± (PPARÎ±), Omega-3 PUFAs significantly boosted fatty acid Î²-oxidation and ATP production in multiple aged organs. Consequently, Omega-3 PUFAs effectively inhibited age-related pathological changes, preserved organ function, and retarded aging process. The beneficial effects of Omega-3 PUFAs were also testified in mfat-1 transgenic mice, which spontaneously generate abundant endogenous Omega-3 PUFAs.

Aging is an inevitable process in the human body, and cellular senescence refers to irreversible cell cycle arrest caused by external aging-promoting mechanisms. Moreover, as age increases, the accumulation of senescent cells limits both the health of the body and lifespan and even accelerates the occurrence and progression of age-related diseases. Therefore, it is crucial to delay the periodic irreversible arrest and continuous accumulation of senescent cells to address the issue of aging. The fundamental solution is targeted therapy focused on eliminating senescent cells or reducing the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Over the past few decades, the remarkable development of nanomaterials has revolutionized clinical drug delivery pathways. Their unique optical, magnetic, and electrical properties effectively compensate for the shortcomings of traditional drugs, such as low stability and short half-life, thereby maximizing the bioavailability and minimizing the toxicity of drug delivery. This article provides an overview of how nanomedicine systems control drug release and achieve effective diagnosis. By presenting and analyzing recent advances in nanotherapy for targeting senescent cells, the underlying mechanisms of nanomedicine for senolytic and senomorphic therapy are clarified, providing great potential for targeting senescent cells.\\n   \n",

Fisetin, a natural flavonoid compound, is a senolytic agent that has shown promise in extending the lifespan of aging mice. Our goal was to determine whether Fisetin can reduce human biological aging, as verified by the TruAge test. This would be the first study in healthy human adults over the age of 50 years old to determine if Fisetin can reduce their biological age. Fisetin 500 mg daily was administered for one week per month for six months. The results showed that four out of ten healthy adults experienced a reduction in biological aging, five out of ten saw an increase, and one out of ten had no change. No adverse effects were noted among the ten subjects. Telomere lengths did not statistically change with the use of Fisetin. Because five of ten had an increase in biological age, taking Fisetin as an anti- aging agent is not recommended until more extensive studies are done.\\n   \n",

Aging is an inevitable biological process that contributes to the onset of age-related diseases, often as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction. Understanding the mechanisms behind aging is crucial for developing therapeutic interventions. This study investigates the effects of curcumin on postmitotic cellular lifespan (PoMiCL) during chronological aging in yeast, a widely used model for human postmitotic cellular aging. Our findings reveal that curcumin significantly prolongs the PoMiCL of wildtype yeast cells, with the most pronounced effects observed at lower concentrations, indicating a hormetic response. Importantly, curcumin also extends the lifespan of postmitotic cells with mitochondrial deficiencies, although the hormetic effect is absent in these defective cells. Mechanistically, curcumin inhibits TORC1 activity, enhances ATP levels, and induces oxidative stress. These results suggest that curcumin has the potential to modulate aging and offer therapeutic insights into age-related diseases, highlighting the importance of context in its effects.\\n   \n",

Extract Effects on Inflammaging. Pomegranate is a notable source of nutrients, containing a considerable proportion of organic acids, polysaccharides, vitamins, fatty acids, and polyphenols such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, and tannins. It is also rich in nutritionally important minerals and chemical elements such as K, P, Na, Ca, Mg, and N. The presence of several bioactive compounds and metabolites in pomegranate has led to its incorporation into the functional food category, where it is used for its numerous therapeutic properties. Pomegranate's bioactive compounds have shown antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. Aging is a process characterized by the chronic accumulation of damages, progressively compromising cells, tissues, and organs over time. Inflammaging is a chronic, subclinical, low-grade inflammation that occurs during the aging process and is linked to many age-related diseases. This review aims to summarize and discuss the evidence of the benefits of pomegranate extract and its compounds to slow the aging processes by intervening in the mechanisms underlying inflammaging. These studies mainly concern neurodegenerative and skin diseases, while studies in other fields of application need to be more practical. Furthermore, no human studies have demonstrated the anti-inflammaging effects of pomegranate. In the future, supplementation with pomegranate extracts, polyphenols, or urolithins could represent a valuable low-risk complementary therapy for patients with difficult-to-manage diseases, as well as a valid therapeutic alternative for the topical or systemic treatment of skin pathologies.\\n   \n",

Aging is the result of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damages over time, meaning that \"the more damage we accumulate, the higher the possibility to develop age-related diseases\". Therefore, to reduce the incidence of such diseases and improve human health, it becomes important to find ways to combat such damage. In this sense, geroprotectors have been suggested as molecules that could slow down or prevent age-related diseases. On the other hand, nutraceuticals are another set of compounds that align with the need to prevent diseases and promote health since they are biologically active molecules (occurring naturally in food) that, apart from having a nutritional role, have preventive properties, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antitumoral, just to mention a few. Therefore, in the present review using the specialized databases Scopus and PubMed we collected information from articles published from 2010 to 2023 in order to describe the role of nutraceuticals during the aging process and, given their role in targeting the hallmarks of aging, we suggest that they are potential geroprotectors that could be consumed as part of our regular diet or administered additionally as nutritional supplements.\\n   \n",

Aging of the face is the result of the interrelation of three-dimensional changes occurring over time among the 5 different layers of the face and its associated structures. Knowledge regarding the causes of these changes and identification of new key anatomic structures have helped elucidate one of the most complex areas of the human body. This has resulted in the introduction of pharmacologic agents to help stop, mitigate, or counteract signs of aging and restore the youthful appearance of the face. The authors performed a systematic search of the literature to review the current highest-level evidence of facial antiaging pharmacologic agents. Pharmacologic and minimally invasive antiaging treatments can target different components of facial aging and continue to evolve. With continuous research efforts, traditional treatments, such as botulinum toxin type A, injectable fillers, and chemical peels, are emerging in newer, more effective formulations, with longer lasting clinical results. However, for soft-tissue descent and facial volume loss, surgery remains the standard treatment. An adequate understanding of the three-dimensional process of facial aging over time (the fourth dimension), facial anatomy, and the pharmacologic properties of antiaging/rejuvenation agents are the sine qua non of facial antiaging treatment. The specific modality should be tailored to patient characteristics, preferences, and goals.\\n   \n",

Our findings reveal that curcumin significantly prolongs the PoMiCL of wildtype yeast cells, with the most pronounced effects observed at lower concentrations, indicating a hormetic response. Importantly, curcumin also extends the lifespan of postmitotic cells with mitochondrial deficiencies, although the hormetic effect is absent in these defective cells.

Analysis of a widely scattered literature indicates that hormones and neural factors regulate a great number of cellular aging phenomena of mammals. It is proposed that age-related changes after maturation result from an extension of the neural and endocrine mechanisms that control earlier development and that produce a regulatory cascade of changing neural, endocrine, and target-tissue interactions.\\n   \n",

In this paper, the rat liver is presented as a promising model for studying cellular phenomena underlying organ ageing. The recent development of methods for isolation and purification of parenchymal, Kupffer and endothelial cells from the rat liver makes possible the comparison of functional and metabolic changes in the intact liver with changes in distinct liver cell classes isolated from rats of various age groups. An attempt has been made to correlate age changes in some important liver-specific functions, such as bromsulophthalein uptake and albumin synthesis, at the organ and at the cellular level. To compare cellular ageing phenomena in long-lived cells (parenchymal cells) and short lived cells (Kupffer and endothelial cells) from the same organ, the role of lysosomes in cellular ageing processes was investigated, with secial reference to the functioning of the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D. The specific cathepsin D activity in Kupffer cells was abour 3 times higher than in endothelial cells and about 20 times higher than in parenchymal cells. The enzyme activity in the latter cell type showed a significant increase with age.\\n   \n",

Furthermore physiological disturbances are superimposed by pathological mechanisms of ageing. As a result the number of diseases in higher age increases as well as there are a lot of therapeutical problems. The following paper tries to reveal that physiological and pathological changes of different organs (heart, kidney, lung, brain) influence the therapy of older man. The results demonstrate that it is necessary to stimulate the research of pharmacodynamics and kinetics in the higher age.\\n   \n",

Difficulties in interpreting the discordant data on age-related changes in pituitary function are discussed. Among mechanisms of reproductive aging are changes at both the ovarian and hypothalamic level (including reduced catecholamine levels, turnover, and synaptosomal uptake). However, it cannot yet be concluded that impairments of hypothalamic catecholamine metabolism are the primary cause for the loss of regular cycles. Evidence for dopaminergic impairments in the basal ganglions of humans and rodents during normal aging suggests that these changes may be a general phenomenon of aging. Although the origins of the changes are not yet known, neuronal cell loss in the substantia nigra would not seem to be the only cause.\\n   \n",

Our goal was to determine whether Fisetin can reduce human biological aging, as verified by the TruAge test. This would be the first study in healthy human adults over the age of 50 years old to determine if Fisetin can reduce their biological age. Fisetin 500 mg daily was administered for one week per month for six months. The results showed that four out of ten healthy adults experienced a reduction in biological aging, five out of ten saw an increase, and one out of ten had no change. No adverse effects were noted among the ten subjects. Telomere lengths did not statistically change with the use of Fisetin. Because five of ten had an increase in biological age, taking Fisetin as an anti- aging agent is not recommended until more extensive studies are done.\\n   \n",

Understanding the mechanisms behind aging is crucial for developing therapeutic interventions. This study investigates the effects of curcumin on postmitotic cellular lifespan (PoMiCL) during chronological aging in yeast, a widely used model for human postmitotic cellular aging. Our findings reveal that curcumin significantly prolongs the PoMiCL of wildtype yeast cells, with the most pronounced effects observed at lower concentrations, indicating a hormetic response. Importantly, curcumin also extends the lifespan of postmitotic cells with mitochondrial deficiencies, although the hormetic effect is absent in these defective cells. Mechanistically, curcumin inhibits TORC1 activity, enhances ATP levels, and induces oxidative stress. These results suggest that curcumin has the potential to modulate aging and offer therapeutic insights into age-related diseases, highlighting the importance of context in its effects.\\n   \n",
       "4544218  Pomegranate is a notable source of nutrients, containing a considerable proportion of organic acids, polysaccharides, vitamins, fatty acids, and polyphenols such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, and tannins. It is also rich in nutritionally important minerals and chemical elements such as K, P, Na, Ca, Mg, and N. The presence of several bioactive compounds and metabolites in pomegranate has led to its incorporation into the functional food category, where it is used for its numerous therapeutic properties. Pomegranate's bioactive compounds have shown antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. Aging is a process characterized by the chronic accumulation of damages, progressively compromising cells, tissues, and organs over time. Inflammaging is a chronic, subclinical, low-grade inflammation that occurs during the aging process and is linked to many age-related diseases. This review aims to summarize and discuss the evidence of the benefits of pomegranate extract and its compounds to slow the aging processes by intervening in the mechanisms underlying inflammaging. These studies mainly concern neurodegenerative and skin diseases, while studies in other fields of application need to be more practical. Furthermore, no human studies have demonstrated the anti-inflammaging effects of pomegranate. In the future, supplementation with pomegranate extracts, polyphenols, or urolithins could represent a valuable low-risk complementary therapy for patients with difficult-to-manage diseases, as well as a valid therapeutic alternative for the topical or systemic treatment of skin pathologies.\\n   \n",

Therefore, to reduce the incidence of such diseases and improve human health, it becomes important to find ways to combat such damage. In this sense, geroprotectors have been suggested as molecules that could slow down or prevent age-related diseases. On the other hand, nutraceuticals are another set of compounds that align with the need to prevent diseases and promote health since they are biologically active molecules (occurring naturally in food) that, apart from having a nutritional role, have preventive properties, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antitumoral, just to mention a few. Therefore, in the present review using the specialized databases Scopus and PubMed we collected information from articles published from 2010 to 2023 in order to describe the role of nutraceuticals during the aging process and, given their role in targeting the hallmarks of aging, we suggest that they are potential geroprotectors that could be consumed as part of our regular diet or administered additionally as nutritional supplements.\\n   \n",

Knowledge regarding the causes of these changes and identification of new key anatomic structures have helped elucidate one of the most complex areas of the human body. This has resulted in the introduction of pharmacologic agents to help stop, mitigate, or counteract signs of aging and restore the youthful appearance of the face. The authors performed a systematic search of the literature to review the current highest-level evidence of facial antiaging pharmacologic agents. Pharmacologic and minimally invasive antiaging treatments can target different components of facial aging and continue to evolve. With continuous research efforts, traditional treatments, such as botulinum toxin type A, injectable fillers, and chemical peels, are emerging in newer, more effective formulations, with longer lasting clinical results. However, for soft-tissue descent and facial volume loss, surgery remains the standard treatment. An adequate understanding of the three-dimensional process of facial aging over time (the fourth dimension), facial anatomy, and the pharmacologic properties of antiaging/rejuvenation agents are the sine qua non of facial antiaging treatment. The specific modality should be tailored to patient characteristics, preferences, and goals.\\n   \n",

Much evidence suggests that intrinsic molecular or cellular aging mechanisms need not be invoked to explain most age-related cellular changes and pathologcical conditions. Analysis of a widely scattered literature indicates that hormones and neural factors regulate a great number of cellular aging phenomena of mammals. It is proposed that age-related changes after maturation result from an extension of the neural and endocrine mechanisms that control earlier development and that produce a regulatory cascade of changing neural, endocrine, and target-tissue interactions.\\n   \n",

The cellular basis of the age-related decline in the functional capacity of many mammalian organs is still poorly understood. In this paper, the rat liver is presented as a promising model for studying cellular phenomena underlying organ ageing. The recent development of methods for isolation and purification of parenchymal, Kupffer and endothelial cells from the rat liver makes possible the comparison of functional and metabolic changes in the intact liver with changes in distinct liver cell classes isolated from rats of various age groups. An attempt has been made to correlate age changes in some important liver-specific functions, such as bromsulophthalein uptake and albumin synthesis, at the organ and at the cellular level. To compare cellular ageing phenomena in long-lived cells (parenchymal cells) and short lived cells (Kupffer and endothelial cells) from the same organ, the role of lysosomes in cellular ageing processes was investigated, with secial reference to the functioning of the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D. The specific cathepsin D activity in Kupffer cells was abour 3 times higher than in endothelial cells and about 20 times higher than in parenchymal cells. The enzyme activity in the latter cell type showed a significant increase with age.\\n   \n",

Molecular and supramolecular mechanisms of ageing involve biochemical, physiological and morphological alterations of organs. Furthermore physiological disturbances are superimposed by pathological mechanisms of ageing. As a result the number of diseases in higher age increases as well as there are a lot of therapeutical problems. The following paper tries to reveal that physiological and pathological changes of different organs (heart, kidney, lung, brain) influence the therapy of older man. The results demonstrate that it is necessary to stimulate the research of pharmacodynamics and kinetics in the higher age.\\n   \n",

Evidence describing altered neuroendocrine function during aging from this and other laboratories is reviewed, with focus on changes in the brain-pituitary-ovarian-adrenal-hepatic and in the brain-pituitary-ovarian systems. Difficulties in interpreting the discordant data on age-related changes in pituitary function are discussed. Among mechanisms of reproductive aging are changes at both the ovarian and hypothalamic level (including reduced catecholamine levels, turnover, and synaptosomal uptake). However, it cannot yet be concluded that impairments of hypothalamic catecholamine metabolism are the primary cause for the loss of regular cycles. Evidence for dopaminergic impairments in the basal ganglions of humans and rodents during normal aging suggests that these changes may be a general phenomenon of aging. Although the origins of the changes are not yet known, neuronal cell loss in the substantia nigra would not seem to be the only cause.\\n   \n",

Fisetin, a natural flavonoid compound, is a senolytic agent that has shown promise in extending the lifespan of aging mice. Our goal was to determine whether Fisetin can reduce human biological aging, as verified by the TruAge test. This would be the first study in healthy human adults over the age of 50 years old to determine if Fisetin can reduce their biological age. Fisetin 500 mg daily was administered for one week per month for six months. The results showed that four out of ten healthy adults experienced a reduction in biological aging, five out of ten saw an increase, and one out of ten had no change. No adverse effects were noted among the ten subjects. Telomere lengths did not statistically change with the use of Fisetin. Because five of ten had an increase in biological age, taking Fisetin as an anti- aging agent is not recommended until more extensive studies are done.\\n   \n",

Aging is an inevitable biological process that contributes to the onset of age-related diseases, often as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction. Understanding the mechanisms behind aging is crucial for developing therapeutic interventions. This study investigates the effects of curcumin on postmitotic cellular lifespan (PoMiCL) during chronological aging in yeast, a widely used model for human postmitotic cellular aging. Our findings reveal that curcumin significantly prolongs the PoMiCL of wildtype yeast cells, with the most pronounced effects observed at lower concentrations, indicating a hormetic response. Importantly, curcumin also extends the lifespan of postmitotic cells with mitochondrial deficiencies, although the hormetic effect is absent in these defective cells. Mechanistically, curcumin inhibits TORC1 activity, enhances ATP levels, and induces oxidative stress. These results suggest that curcumin has the potential to modulate aging and offer therapeutic insights into age-related diseases, highlighting the importance of context in its effects.\\n   \n",
       "4544218  Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) Extract Effects on Inflammaging. Pomegranate is a notable source of nutrients, containing a considerable proportion of organic acids, polysaccharides, vitamins, fatty acids, and polyphenols such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, and tannins. It is also rich in nutritionally important minerals and chemical elements such as K, P, Na, Ca, Mg, and N. The presence of several bioactive compounds and metabolites in pomegranate has led to its incorporation into the functional food category, where it is used for its numerous therapeutic properties. Pomegranate's bioactive compounds have shown antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. Aging is a process characterized by the chronic accumulation of damages, progressively compromising cells, tissues, and organs over time. Inflammaging is a chronic, subclinical, low-grade inflammation that occurs during the aging process and is linked to many age-related diseases. This review aims to summarize and discuss the evidence of the benefits of pomegranate extract and its compounds to slow the aging processes by intervening in the mechanisms underlying inflammaging. These studies mainly concern neurodegenerative and skin diseases, while studies in other fields of application need to be more practical. Furthermore, no human studies have demonstrated the anti-inflammaging effects of pomegranate. In the future, supplementation with pomegranate extracts, polyphenols, or urolithins could represent a valuable low-risk complementary therapy for patients with difficult-to-manage diseases, as well as a valid therapeutic alternative for the topical or systemic treatment of skin pathologies.\\n   \n",

Aging is the result of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damages over time, meaning that \"the more damage we accumulate, the higher the possibility to develop age-related diseases\". Therefore, to reduce the incidence of such diseases and improve human health, it becomes important to find ways to combat such damage. In this sense, geroprotectors have been suggested as molecules that could slow down or prevent age-related diseases. On the other hand, nutraceuticals are another set of compounds that align with the need to prevent diseases and promote health since they are biologically active molecules (occurring naturally in food) that, apart from having a nutritional role, have preventive properties, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antitumoral, just to mention a few. Therefore, in the present review using the specialized databases Scopus and PubMed we collected information from articles published from 2010 to 2023 in order to describe the role of nutraceuticals during the aging process and, given their role in targeting the hallmarks of aging, we suggest that they are potential geroprotectors that could be consumed as part of our regular diet or administered additionally as nutritional supplements.\\n   \n",

Aging of the face is the result of the interrelation of three-dimensional changes occurring over time among the 5 different layers of the face and its associated structures. Knowledge regarding the causes of these changes and identification of new key anatomic structures have helped elucidate one of the most complex areas of the human body. This has resulted in the introduction of pharmacologic agents to help stop, mitigate, or counteract signs of aging and restore the youthful appearance of the face. The authors performed a systematic search of the literature to review the current highest-level evidence of facial antiaging pharmacologic agents. Pharmacologic and minimally invasive antiaging treatments can target different components of facial aging and continue to evolve. With continuous research efforts, traditional treatments, such as botulinum toxin type A, injectable fillers, and chemical peels, are emerging in newer, more effective formulations, with longer lasting clinical results. However, for soft-tissue descent and facial volume loss, surgery remains the standard treatment. An adequate understanding of the three-dimensional process of facial aging over time (the fourth dimension), facial anatomy, and the pharmacologic properties of antiaging/rejuvenation agents are the sine qua non of facial antiaging treatment. The specific modality should be tailored to patient characteristics, preferences, and goals.\\n   \n",

       "      <td>The cellular basis of the age-related decline in the functional capacity of many mammalian organs is still poorly understood. In this paper, the rat liver is presented as a promising model for studying cellular phenomena underlying organ ageing. The recent development of methods for isolation and purification of parenchymal, Kupffer and endothelial cells from the rat liver makes possible the comparison of functional and metabolic changes in the intact liver with changes in distinct liver cell classes isolated from rats of various age groups.

Much evidence suggests that intrinsic molecular or cellular aging mechanisms need not be invoked to explain most age-related cellular changes and pathologcical conditions. Analysis of a widely scattered literature indicates that hormones and neural factors regulate a great number of cellular aging phenomena of mammals. It is proposed that age-related changes after maturation result from an extension of the neural and endocrine mechanisms that control earlier development and that produce a regulatory cascade of changing neural, endocrine, and target-tissue interactions.\\n   \n",
       "13  Model systems for studies on cellular basis of organ ageing. The cellular basis of the age-related decline in the functional capacity of many mammalian organs is still poorly understood. In this paper, the rat liver is presented as a promising model for studying cellular phenomena underlying organ ageing. The recent development of methods for isolation and purification of parenchymal, Kupffer and endothelial cells from the rat liver makes possible the comparison of functional and metabolic changes in the intact liver with changes in distinct liver cell classes isolated from rats of various age groups. An attempt has been made to correlate age changes in some important liver-specific functions, such as bromsulophthalein uptake and albumin synthesis, at the organ and at the cellular level. To compare cellular ageing phenomena in long-lived cells (parenchymal cells) and short lived cells (Kupffer and endothelial cells) from the same organ, the role of lysosomes in cellular ageing processes was investigated, with secial reference to the functioning of the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D. The specific cathepsin D activity in Kupffer cells was abour 3 times higher than in endothelial cells and about 20 times higher than in parenchymal cells. The enzyme activity in the latter cell type showed a significant increase with age.\\n   \n",

Molecular and supramolecular mechanisms of ageing involve biochemical, physiological and morphological alterations of organs. Furthermore physiological disturbances are superimposed by pathological mechanisms of ageing. As a result the number of diseases in higher age increases as well as there are a lot of therapeutical problems. The following paper tries to reveal that physiological and pathological changes of different organs (heart, kidney, lung, brain) influence the therapy of older man. The results demonstrate that it is necessary to stimulate the research of pharmacodynamics and kinetics in the higher age.\\n   \n",

Evidence describing altered neuroendocrine function during aging from this and other laboratories is reviewed, with focus on changes in the brain-pituitary-ovarian-adrenal-hepatic and in the brain-pituitary-ovarian systems. Difficulties in interpreting the discordant data on age-related changes in pituitary function are discussed. Among mechanisms of reproductive aging are changes at both the ovarian and hypothalamic level (including reduced catecholamine levels, turnover, and synaptosomal uptake). However, it cannot yet be concluded that impairments of hypothalamic catecholamine metabolism are the primary cause for the loss of regular cycles. Evidence for dopaminergic impairments in the basal ganglions of humans and rodents during normal aging suggests that these changes may be a general phenomenon of aging. Although the origins of the changes are not yet known, neuronal cell loss in the substantia nigra would not seem to be the only cause.\\n   \n",

The interrelationships between diet and life span are reviewed, with emphasis on results obtained in studies with experimental animals. Ad libitum feeding throughout life does not promote maximal survival and food restriction increases mean life span. The possible importance of total energy, carbohydrate, and protein intake are considered, as well as the influence of mode of feeding. A number of mechanisms that might explain how nutrition affects life span are discussed, including disease pattern, free radicals, neuroendocrine system, and protein turnover. The significance of these findings in relation to the health and life span of human subjects is not known and deserves further exploration. However, they emphasize the importance of diet as a tool to help explore the biochemical and physiological basis for aging in animal models.\\n   \n",

The recent development of methods for isolation and purification of parenchymal, Kupffer and endothelial cells from the rat liver makes possible the comparison of functional and metabolic changes in the intact liver with changes in distinct liver cell classes isolated from rats of various age groups. An attempt has been made to correlate age changes in some important liver-specific functions, such as bromsulophthalein uptake and albumin synthesis, at the organ and at the cellular level. To compare cellular ageing phenomena in long-lived cells (parenchymal cells) and short lived cells (Kupffer and endothelial cells) from the same organ, the role of lysosomes in cellular ageing processes was investigated, with secial reference to the functioning of the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D. The specific cathepsin D activity in Kupffer cells was abour 3 times higher than in endothelial cells and about 20 times higher than in parenchymal cells.

Analysis of a widely scattered literature indicates that hormones and neural factors regulate a great number of cellular aging phenomena of mammals. It is proposed that age-related changes after maturation result from an extension of the neural and endocrine mechanisms that control earlier development and that produce a regulatory cascade of changing neural, endocrine, and target-tissue interactions.\\n   \n",
       "13  The cellular basis of the age-related decline in the functional capacity of many mammalian organs is still poorly understood. In this paper, the rat liver is presented as a promising model for studying cellular phenomena underlying organ ageing. The recent development of methods for isolation and purification of parenchymal, Kupffer and endothelial cells from the rat liver makes possible the comparison of functional and metabolic changes in the intact liver with changes in distinct liver cell classes isolated from rats of various age groups. An attempt has been made to correlate age changes in some important liver-specific functions, such as bromsulophthalein uptake and albumin synthesis, at the organ and at the cellular level. To compare cellular ageing phenomena in long-lived cells (parenchymal cells) and short lived cells (Kupffer and endothelial cells) from the same organ, the role of lysosomes in cellular ageing processes was investigated, with secial reference to the functioning of the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D. The specific cathepsin D activity in Kupffer cells was abour 3 times higher than in endothelial cells and about 20 times higher than in parenchymal cells. The enzyme activity in the latter cell type showed a significant increase with age.\\n   \n",

Much evidence suggests that intrinsic molecular or cellular aging mechanisms need not be invoked to explain most age-related cellular changes and pathologcical conditions. Analysis of a widely scattered literature indicates that hormones and neural factors regulate a great number of cellular aging phenomena of mammals. It is proposed that age-related changes after maturation result from an extension of the neural and endocrine mechanisms that control earlier development and that produce a regulatory cascade of changing neural, endocrine, and target-tissue interactions.\\n   \n",
       "13  Model systems for studies on cellular basis of organ ageing. The cellular basis of the age-related decline in the functional capacity of many mammalian organs is still poorly understood. In this paper, the rat liver is presented as a promising model for studying cellular phenomena underlying organ ageing. The recent development of methods for isolation and purification of parenchymal, Kupffer and endothelial cells from the rat liver makes possible the comparison of functional and metabolic changes in the intact liver with changes in distinct liver cell classes isolated from rats of various age groups. An attempt has been made to correlate age changes in some important liver-specific functions, such as bromsulophthalein uptake and albumin synthesis, at the organ and at the cellular level. To compare cellular ageing phenomena in long-lived cells (parenchymal cells) and short lived cells (Kupffer and endothelial cells) from the same organ, the role of lysosomes in cellular ageing processes was investigated, with secial reference to the functioning of the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D. The specific cathepsin D activity in Kupffer cells was abour 3 times higher than in endothelial cells and about 20 times higher than in parenchymal cells. The enzyme activity in the latter cell type showed a significant increase with age.\\n   \n",

Molecular and supramolecular mechanisms of ageing involve biochemical, physiological and morphological alterations of organs. Furthermore physiological disturbances are superimposed by pathological mechanisms of ageing. As a result the number of diseases in higher age increases as well as there are a lot of therapeutical problems. The following paper tries to reveal that physiological and pathological changes of different organs (heart, kidney, lung, brain) influence the therapy of older man. The results demonstrate that it is necessary to stimulate the research of pharmacodynamics and kinetics in the higher age.\\n   \n",

Evidence describing altered neuroendocrine function during aging from this and other laboratories is reviewed, with focus on changes in the brain-pituitary-ovarian-adrenal-hepatic and in the brain-pituitary-ovarian systems. Difficulties in interpreting the discordant data on age-related changes in pituitary function are discussed. Among mechanisms of reproductive aging are changes at both the ovarian and hypothalamic level (including reduced catecholamine levels, turnover, and synaptosomal uptake). However, it cannot yet be concluded that impairments of hypothalamic catecholamine metabolism are the primary cause for the loss of regular cycles. Evidence for dopaminergic impairments in the basal ganglions of humans and rodents during normal aging suggests that these changes may be a general phenomenon of aging. Although the origins of the changes are not yet known, neuronal cell loss in the substantia nigra would not seem to be the only cause.\\n   \n",

We describe the role played by specialised proresolving lipid mediators (SPMs) in the resolution of inflammation and how insufficient levels of these mediators, or compromised responsiveness may play a role in the pathogenesis of many ageing-associated pathologies, e.g. Alzheimer's Disease, atherosclerosis, obesity, diabetes and kidney disease. Detailed examination of the resolution phase of inflammation highlights the potential to harness these lipid mediators and or mimetics of their bioactions, in particular, their synthetic analogues to promote effective resolution of inflammation, without compromising the host immune system.\\n   \n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.

Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
